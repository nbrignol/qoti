"The Quest of the Incrementalist"

An experiment of building a classic 2D game from the ground-up, by very small increments, based on simple user-stories.

The main idea is to make a playable game at each step of the development session, which will probably never end.
Every iteration will bring a new simple feature, like moving hero, collecting coins, providing a pause menu, score count, etc.

Here is a list of potential "user stories", from the very first steps :
 X Hero is centered on the screen.
 X Hero move to right or left while player press the right or left arrow.
